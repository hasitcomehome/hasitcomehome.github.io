# It's coming home!
* Has it come home yet?
* When is it coming home?
* Do we know who to ask when is it coming home?

These are all questions being asked in modern society.

At hasitcomehome.com, weâ€™re building a new kind of experience. One that lives on your device and built for the way you live today.

We are all about transparency, so check out our transparent roadmap below:
